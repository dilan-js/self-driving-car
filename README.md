# self-driving-car
A self driving car JavaScript application w/Machine Learning and Neural Networks!

##### Hi! This is my self-driving car application using neural networks and Vanilla JavaScript!

- ⚠️ Beware, running this may slow down your browser. 
- This project is an example of how to create a neural network in JS with modern JavaScript princples. 
- Although a basic iteration of a NN, there are several ways to expand this project, which I plan to do in the future: curved roads, better UI, more obstacles etc. 
- I also built a visualizer I learned how to make a while ago from an awesome programmer that shows how the NN is working in-real-time. 
- To run, simply run the html file on your Chrome or other browser.
Enjoy :)
